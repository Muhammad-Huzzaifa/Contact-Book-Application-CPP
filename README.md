# Contact-Book-Application-CPP
An OOP based contact book application for console
<br>
<p>
  This a basic console based contact book application that involves OOP(Object Oriented Programming) concepts of C++.<br>
  In this project I use text files for saving and manuplating the data of stored contacts instead of data base.<br>
  <h3>In this you are able to:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add and delete contact</li>
    <li>Update contact</li>
    <li>Search contact by first name, last name, or phone number</li>
    <li>Able to see search history and frequently viewed contacts</li>
    <li>Able to make delete groups and also add and remove contacts from them</li>
  </ul>
</p>
